# GDG-NMIT
project for my college gdsc 
The page opens to home page of gdsc nmit and shows us the title and shows us the other options in the navbar.
Next you could open about us page which gives us an overview of the gdsc page and next you could click events.
In the events we see old events and we can submit feedback for those events, whereas in the new events we could regitser for.
In the join us page we can see submission form for the joining of the club and we could also upload a resume if needed.
Then at the last we can see login page.
